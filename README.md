There are 3 notebooks (about 30 mins each):
1. [See the Data](https://github.com/aayancheng/HighSchoolDataScience/blob/Master/Seethedata_DataVisualization.ipynb)
2. [Guess the House Price](https://github.com/aayancheng/HighSchoolDataScience/blob/Master/HousePrice_LinearRegression.ipynb)
3. [Can you read the numbers?](https://github.com/aayancheng/HighSchoolDataScience/blob/Master/Guessthenumber_tensorflow.ipynb)

There are 2 ways to run the notebooks: 
* Easy and no installation. Simply Click the button to launch a binder session.  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aayancheng/HighSchoolDataScience/Master)
* More flexibile and require installation. Install Jupyter Lab on your PC via [Anaconda package](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and copy the codes to run in your local session.
